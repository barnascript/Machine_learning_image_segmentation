Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions based on certain characteristics, such as color, texture, intensity, or shape. The goal of image segmentation is to simplify the representation of an image, making it easier to analyze or understand. It plays a crucial role in various computer vision tasks, including object recognition, scene understanding, and medical image analysis.

There are different approaches to image segmentation, including:

1. **Thresholding**: Divides the image into regions based on pixel intensity values.
2. **Clustering**: Groups similar pixels together using techniques like K-means clustering.
3. **Edge-based segmentation**: Identifies boundaries between different regions using edge detection algorithms.
4. **Region-based segmentation**: Divides the image into regions based on properties such as color homogeneity or texture similarity.
5. **Semantic segmentation**: Assigns a class label to each pixel in the image, distinguishing between different objects or regions.

Image segmentation has various applications across industries, including medical imaging (e.g., tumor detection), autonomous driving (e.g., identifying pedestrians and vehicles), satellite imaging (e.g., land cover classification), and security (e.g., surveillance systems).
